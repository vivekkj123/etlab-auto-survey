> A chrome extension for filling faculty/course evaluation at one click

## Background

At the conclusion of every semester, students are required to complete faculty/course evaluations in order to access the Linways portal. If you're in a hurry to check your attendance or view your internal marks, this can be quite inconvenient. To simplify the process, I developed this extension.
